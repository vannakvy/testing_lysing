          It seems like everyone is online these days. The Internet not only
          facilitates interpersonal communication between users (e.g., email,
          social media); it's also a much relied-upon source for all kinds of
          information. And a convenient means of paying bills and making
          purchases. Every single online application has that part with which
          users interact. When you log onto a website, you are greeted by the
          welcome page, the menu, site map, and other items that facilitate
          navigation and utility. All of those items fall under the collective
          term of “front end.” The front end includes the user interface, which
          is the part of the website or app designed for the consumer's use.
          Without further ado, before getting started with how to become a
          front-end developer let us first undersatnd what is a front end
          developer.

    <div class="text-box">
      <p>
        A front end developer, also known as a front end web developer, is a
        professional responsible for the design and implementation of the
        interface. The users require this interface so that they can access the
        application in question. A web designer is a professional who creates a
        websites appearance and design. And the front end developer makes sure
        that the design works online by using coding languages such as CSS,
        HTML, and JavaScript.

        earn an average of $86,178 per year. A “regular” front-end developer can
